            <h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER ?</h2>
            <p>
                A <span>computer</span> <strong>is an electronic device that processes data to
                 perform specific tasks. </strong> It can <strong><i>store</i></strong>, <strong><i>
                    retrieve </i></strong>,
                  and <strong><i></i>manage vast amounts of information quickly 
                  and accurately </strong>. <br> Computers have become essential 
                  in today’s world, helping people in various fields

                    A computer is an electronic device designed to
                     perform a variety of tasks by processing data.
                </li>
                <li>It can execute a set of instructions (software)
                     to solve problems, automate tasks, or perform calculations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Functions of a Computer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> Receiving data from a user or external device (e.g., keyboard, mouse).</li>
                <li><strong>Processing: </strong>Performing operations on the data (e.g., calculations, logic).</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Displaying or providing results (e.g., monitor, printer).</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Saving data for future use (e.g., hard drive, cloud storage).</li>
